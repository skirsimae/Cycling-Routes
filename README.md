# Cycling-Routes
Final project of NYCDA bootcamp.

Website that gives information about sightseeings and cycling route starting points in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. 

The personal objective of this project, was to learn how work with API-s. For this project specifically, I used Under Armour API and Google Maps API. 
The website gives information about some most known sightseeings in Apeldoorn with the Google Maps indicating the locations with image tags of the specific places. The "Routes" page gives information about several cycling route starting points with the indication of the name of the route and distance. The information of the coordinates of these points was retrieved from mapmyride.com (Under Armour API).
